<p class="lead">is the highest mountain in Africa with a height of about 4,900 meters from its base and 5,895 meters above the sea level. It is within the Kilimanjaro National Park and is a major climbing destination attracting celebrities and adventure sportspersons. Even if it’s situated near the equator, it is famous for its snow-capped mountain tops offering alluring landscapes. Even though there are no special skills or technical gears needed for Mount Kilimanjaro Climbing, the climbers are required to be physically fit and trained. Nevertheless, it’s a great place to relish.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>WEATHER, SEASONS &amp; TIMING</b> The best times to climb regarding to the weather (avoiding rain) is from January to early March, and June to mid-October. There’s a long, dry winter and a green season with two rainy periods at each end. December, January, February and March are the warmest months, with clear mornings and evenings, and clouds during the day that occlude the summit in the early afternoon hours. The predictable patterns of weather make it a good time to climb. The main rain season lasts from beginning of April to early June. At this time, dense cloud formations are massed over the mountain reducing visibility, and you can expect frequent snowstorms on the summit and heavy rains on the lower slopes. The longest and driest season runs from mid-June to mid-October. During this time it can be very cold at night. During Kilimanjaro’s “winter,” there is a persistent dripping belt of clouds girdling the whole mountain above the forests and the moorland contour. Leaving the summit a few other distant peaks poking through. Above the clouds it is usually clear and dry, and thus is one of the best times to plan the trek. In late October, it finally rains, and until the middle of December, the mountain is shrouded in heavy clouds, with persistent showers from the base to the summit. The best months to ascend the mountain are January, February, March, June, July, August, September and early October. Avoid climbing during the heavy rain season between April and May, and November (the short rains) if you can. </p>
        <p><b>&nbsp;TRAVELLING INFORMATION:</b> If you arrive at the Kilimanjaro International Airport, you will be met by VictorTrekking&amp;Safari representative and transferred to your hotel in Moshi or Arusha. We recommend at least one day rest before starting your trek. If you are transferring from Nairobi, Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar, this can act as your rest day. If you have time, a bit walks and shopping in Moshi town. In the evening your guide will provide a briefing before your trek and do an equipment check, those which are missing they can be rented. Extra luggage can be stored in a locked storage room at your hotel in Moshi at no charge. The next morning, after breakfast you will be pick up with our driver and your guide and drive to the park gate. Depending on the route you take, the drive to the trailhead can take up to one hour to the park gate. Once you reach the park gate, climbers are requested to make their final preparations for the climb and sign the national park registration book. Porters will be seen arranging their packs containing the food, water, and other equipment. Make sure that you have all your day pack items with you as the porters travel very quickly. The average hiking day begins between 8-9am and is about 4 to 6 hours, walking very slowly (pole pole). The distances you will hike each day are very moderate so as to acclimatize a little at a time. the terrain lower down is absolutely gorgeous and fascinating. Higher up, the views are vast. There is little to do at the camps themselves, so take advantage of the slow pace to absorb the scenery and take every photo opportunity. The hike to the summit starts around midnight depending on your route and speed of your group. You will go as high as you feel fit. Some people stop at the crater rim, and others continue to the very highest point on the mountain. At the summit you will have a chance of taking nice photos while enjoying great views with sunrise. Afterwards your guide will take you down to the campsite for hot lunch and short rest before descend to the last camp for dinner and overnight. You can add an extra day at the Horombo Huts (3720m). You can spend a full day and a second night at Horombo. On this day, you can either rest at the huts or walk up to zebra rock for acclimatization and taking nice photos on a beautiful view before return to your hut for lunch and overnight. This extra day will help your acclimatization, and further your understanding of the mountain’s weather and altitude. After your pause, you will continue up to the Kibo Huts on your fourth day for your midnight start to the summit.</p><hr>
